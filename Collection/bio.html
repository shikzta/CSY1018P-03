        <h1> Bio of my Supercar collection </h1>
            <p> What's a supercar? A supercar also known as an exotic car is a loosely defined description of a certain high-performance street-legal sportscars. Since the 1990s or 2000s, the term hypercar has come into use for the highest performing supercars. </p>
            <p> So then what's a hyper car? A more recent term for high-performance sportscars is "hypercar" which can sometimes be used to describe the highest performing supercars. As per supercars, there is no set definition for what constitutes a hypercar. One interpretation is a limited-production, range-topping model priced above US$1,000,000.
                    Some people consider the 1993 McLaren F1 to be the first hypercar, while others believe the 2005 Bugatti Veyron was the first hypercar </p>
